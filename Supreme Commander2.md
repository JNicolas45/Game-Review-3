### Rating

Though time has ravaged this 10-year-old game its still surprisingly fun after all this time despite problems which can hinder the player's experience (I Currently own it on PC) I rate this game a 4/5 

## Summary

Supreme Commander 2's story is split with 3 factions whose main commanding units became friends in their years at the academy. Beforehand there were 25 years of peace that took place after the events of the first game. Fast forward and there was an assassination of a newly elected president which broke the peace treaty resulting in every faction either denying involvement or blaming others thus war began again. You first play as the UEF commanded by Dominic Maddox. After serving your life to the UEF you are tasked with destroying the New Cathedral Colony home to Illuminate scum to which Maddox refuses because his son and wife are there. After telling General Rodgers you cannot because you and your family ARE Illuminate he becomes furious and demands your surrender, you eventually escape and are now rouge to the UEF. Later, you meet up with an old friend and eventually take out an arrogant Commander Coleman who tries to kill you. After defeating him you make your way to New Cathedral to evacuate civilians, but you're heated up after another commander throws a nuke at you, you get your revenge killing the commander and now you set your sites on General Rodgers. You then meet him at his heavily defended location to which you gain another ally. Out of desperation, General Rodgers attempts to persuade you to stand down while also killing your ally. This enrages Maddox and with the help of 2 MEGA UNITS, you kill him by blowing up 2 massive generators. The explosion did kill General Rodgers but then something sinister appears after his death which then makes way to the Illuminate Campaign.

The Illuminate campaign has you play as Thalia Kael. You mostly combat Cybran scum. You start by gathering intelligence from your sister that there's a hidden Cybran submarine somewhere near your location due to its stealth capabilities. You soon find out the Cybran Navy are on their way to regroup with said Cybran submarine. You eventually find it and blow it up. After hacking into a nearby reserve station you accidentally set off the alarm to reactivate all offline units and factories. There's also intel about a hidden prototype unit that you must destroy, courtesy of the Cybran Navy. You eventually defeat the prototype unit and await further orders. You get intel that you must infiltrate a prison and break out captured Royal Guardian Officials, unfortunately, gunships don't make it easy but eventually you capture the prison releasing the Guardian Officials. You get word to investigate a possible UEF attack while also working with Gauge, an unknown ally whom you confronted with already in the UEF campaign. After finding out the UEF bases have Experimental Artillery and taking them down one by one you find out that you were manipulated by Gauge to destroy UEF Technology bases thus marking this as an act of war on behalf of the Illuminate. Gauge leaves but tells you a certain commander defended the base long before you arrived. After beating confronting and defeating Gauge while he's running away he reveals after everything you've done under his command "You will go down in history as the most successful terrorist in Illuminate History." Gauge already sent in 3 commanders to deal with your old friend Maddox, you help him by nuking the 3 fellow Illuminate commanders thus sparking an "Act of War". You meet Maddox at the Dam again where he defeated General Rodgers and explains that launching a nuke will destroy the Dam but at the cost of their ACU's however you two survive the blast by hunkering down. Despite this Gaige laughs as he leaves just in time through a portal. You gain help from other fellow Illuminate comrades and is now the UEF and Illuminate versus Gaige and the Cybran. This starts the final act of the game as you play as commander Ivan Brackman for the Cybran.

The Cybran campaign starts off with you playing as Ivan Brackman the son to the famous Dr.Brackman. Your tasked with defending a Proto-Brain complex while being assaulted by Gauge and his forces, after defending it for what seems forever you eventually self destruct the facility so that Gaige won't get any information out of the Proto-Brains. You eventually espace to assist on New Terra as a distress call from a scientist requires your aid. You however land at Gate world before hand. You're tasked with disposing of all facilities from rogue engineers whom constructed a Large Server core which you must capture and bring back the data to your father. You are successful and finally teleport to New Terra. You learn furious Illuminate forces are after files about Shiva Prime, you even fight off against an Illuminate commander. You then learn the Dr. you've been assisting has a unit you'd be interrested in and test its combat abilites. After such fun you make your way to Altar II. Upon arriving eventually help out Maddox and Thalia both of whom are great pals with Ivan to repel the Guardians's commanders they've sent after you. After a grueling fight with tremendous losses you 3 have a chance to talk. Maddox confesses that he took out General Rodgers meanwhile Thailia replies with saying she knows shes going to pay for her crimes but will find justice. Gauge appears and quickly angers Thalia but Ivan reminds her there'll be another time and that the portal must be protected. You are then headed to a docking station at Shiva Prime Seraohim VII. You quickly defeat an arrogant Illuminate commander who wants your head because you killed the Guardian's Annointed commanders. You then head to Shiva Prime and encounter Gaige who is trying to destroy the planet. After defending your quantum shields from Gaige you finally beat him to a pulp but you feel sorry because he too is Cybran. Thus letting him escape while he tones out some monologue about how you made a grave mistake. You then decide to destroy the portal to Shiva Prime as it cannot be in the wrong hands. You survive the explosion and thus the ending is revealed. You stopped the mislead civial war and as Ivan you make a speech about why the UEF,Illuminate and Cybran need to come together again as Gaige is still out there. But in the end Maddox finally sees his family but Thalia has been arrested due to her crimes while also learning her brother died during the time she was with Maddox defending the portal. Truly a cliffhanger as Gaige is seen merging the data from the Proto-Brain you've destroyed into you're father's brain. Gaige then whipsers that he won't let Brackman down again. And that's the end. 


## Final Thoughts
Overall a very fun tactical game that takes inspiration from Starcraft. Now the meat of the game: Skirmishes and Multiplayer. In Skirmish, you can play any game mode such as Total Control, Assassination, or Resouce Control while also choosing what to set the AI play settings on such as Turtle, Assault, Pure Navy, Pure Ground Units or well-rounded, etc. Not forgetting that you can choose what faction you and your AI opponent can be. The maps are also great because each requires a different strategy compared to the degenerate and frowned upon "Illuminate Bomber" strategy as described below. 

Multiplayer: The UEF boast amazing artillery and high shield health, Illuminate boast the best mobility while also being great all-rounders and Cybran boast the best stealth and Naval Units as a late-game upgrade allows Naval units to walk on land and wreak even more havoc. In the current meta which is always used, pick Illuminate as their starter fighters are also bombers, upon starting the game immediately make Air Factories and start building fighters. Once you have around at least 10 fighters/bombers immediately send them out to the enemy base as they will hardly have any anti-air defenses and watch as your bombers win you the game as they eviscerate the enemy base and ACU. Overall i like how the game is a refresher to killing aliens to defeating giant monsters, its a nice change of pace to see something different other than generic monsters, aliens or zombies. I do love the upgrade system as even the weakest units can be turned into badasses, also i love how the campaign has side objectives and that once completed you get special dialogue and that you feel accoplished for completing said objectives.
