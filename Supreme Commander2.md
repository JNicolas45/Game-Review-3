## Summary

Supreme Commander 2's story is split with 3 factions whose main commanding units became friends in their years at the academy. Before hand there was 25 years of peace which took place after the events of the first game. Fast foward and there was an assasination of a newly elected president which broke the peace treaty resulting in every faction either denying involvement or blaming others thus war began again. You first play as the UEF commanded by Dominic Maddox. After serving your life to the UEF you are tasked of destroying the New Cathedral Colony home to Illuminate scum to which Maddox refuses because his son and wife are there. After telling General Rodgers you cannot because you and your family ARE Illuminate he becomes furious and demands your surrender, you eventually escpare and are now rouge to the UEF. Later, you meet up with an old friend and eventually take out an arrogant Commander Coleman who tries to kill you. After defeating him you make your way to New Cathedral to evacuate civilains, but your heated up after another commander throws a nuke at you, you get your revenge killing the commander and now you set your sites on General Rodgers. You then meet him at his heavily defended location to which you gain another ally. Out of desperation General Rodgers attemps to persuade you to stand down while also killing your ally. This enrages Maddox and with the help of 2 MEGA UNITS you kill him by blowing up 2 massive generators. The explosion did kill General Rodgers but then something sinister appears after his death which then makes way to the Illuminate Campaign.

The Illuminate campaign has you play as Thalia Kael. You mostly combat Cybran scum. You start off by gathering intelligence from your sister that there's a hidden Cybran submarine somewhere near your location due to its stealth capabilities. You soon find out the Cybran Navy are on their way to regroup with said Cybran submarine. You eventually find it and blow it up. After hacking into a nearby resever station you accidentally set off the alarm to reactivate all offline units and factories. There's also intel about a hidden prototype unit that you must destroy, courtesy of the Cybran Navy. You eventually defeat the prototype unit and await further orders. You get intel that you must infiltrate a prison and break out captured Royal Guardian Officials, unfortunately gunships don't make it easy but eventually you capture the prison releasing the Guardian Officials. You get word to investigate a possible UEF attack while also working with Gauge, an unknown ally whom you confronted with already in the UEF campaign. After finding out the UEF bases have Experimental Atrillery and taking them down one by one you find out that you were maniuplated by Gauge to destroy UEF Technology bases thus marking this as an act of war on behalf of the Illuminate. Gauge leaves but tells you a certain commander defended the base long before you arrived. After beating confronting and defeating Gauge while he's running away he reveals after everything you've done under his command "You will go down in history as the most successful terrorist in Illuminate History." Gauge already sent in 3 commanders to deal with your old friend Maddox, you help him by nuking the 3 fellow Illuminate commanders thus sparking an "Act of War". You meet Maddox at the Dam again where he defeated General Rodgers and explains that launching a nuke will destroy the Dam but at the cost of their ACU's however you two survive the blast by hunkering down. Despite this Gauge laughs as he leaves just in time through a portal. You gain help from other fellow Illuminate commrades and is now the UEF and Illuminate versus Gaige and the Cybran. This starts the final act of the game as you play as commander Ivan Brackman for the Cybran.

The Cybran campaign starts off with you playing as Ivan Brackman the son to the famous Dr.Brackman. Your tasked with defending a Proto-Brain complex while being assaulted by Gauge and his forces, after defending it for what seems forever you eventually self destruct the facility so that Gauge won't get any information out of the Proto-Brains. You eventually espace to assist on New Terra as a distress call from a scientist requires your aid. You however land at Gate world before hand. You're tasked with disposing of all facilities from rogue engineers whom constructed a Large Serve core which you must capture and bring back the data to your father. You are successful and finally teleport to New Terra. You learn furious Illuminate forces are after files about Shiva Prime, you even fight off against an Illuminate commander. You then learn the Dr. you've been assisting has a unit you'd be interrested in and test its combat abilites. After such fun you make your way to Altar II. Upon arriving eventually help out Maddox and Thalia both of whom are great pals with Ivan to repel the Guardians's commanders they've sent after you. After a grueling fight with tremendous losses you 3 have a chance to talk. Maddox confesses that he took out General Rodgers meanwhile Thailia replies with saying she knows shes going to pay for her crimes but will find justice. Gauge appears and quickly angers Thalia but Ivan reminds her there'll be another time and that the portal must be protected. You are then headed to a docking station at Shiva Prime Seraohim VII. You quickly defeat an arrogant Illuminate commander who wants your head because you killed the Guardian's Annointed commanders. You then head to Shiva Prime and encounter Gauge who is trying to destroy the planet. After defending your quantum shields from Gauge you finally beat him to a pulp but you feel sorry because he too is Cybran. Thus letting him escape while he tones out some monologue about how you made a grave mistake. You then decide to destroy the portal to Shiva Prime as it cannot be in the wrong hands. You survive the explosion and thus the ending is revealed. You stopped the mislead civial war and as Ivan you make a speech about why the UEF,Illuminate and Cybran need to come together again as Gauge is still out there. But in the end Maddox finally sees his family but Thalia has been arrested due to her crimes while also learning her brother died during the time she was with Maddox defending the portal. Truly a cliffhanger as Gauge is seen merging the data from the Proto-Brain you've destroyed into you're father's brain. Gauge then whipsers that he won't let Brackman down again. And that's the end. 


## Final Thoughts
Overall a very fun tactical game which takes inspiration from Starcraft. Now the meat of the game: Skirmishes and Mulitplayer. In Skirmish you can play any game mode such as Total Control, Assisination, or Resouce Control while also choosing what to set the AI play settings on such as Turtle, Assault, Pure Navy, Pure Ground Units or well-rounded. The maps are also great because each require a differernt strategy compared to the degenerate and frowned upon "Illuminate Bomber" strategy as described below. 

Mulitplayer: The UEF boast amazing artillery and high sheild health, Illuminate boast best mobility while also being great all-rounders and Cybran boast best stealth and Navy Units as a late-game upgrade allows Naval units to walk on land and wreak even more havoc. In the current meta which is always used pick Illuminate as their starter fighters are also bombers, upon starting the game immediatly make Air Facories and start building fighters. Once you have around at least 10 fighters/bombers immediatly send them out to the enemy base as they will hardly have any anti-air defenses and watch as your bombers win you the game as they evicarate the enemy base and ACU. Each faction have various units each with their own strenghts and weaknesses however hit mid-game and prepare for utter desctuction as by that point each faction should already have started assembling their GOD TIER units. What's also great with Skirmishes and Multiplayer is choosing up to 4 players to fight with or against, Free for All or Teams. The DLC which adds new and old fan favourite units from the first Supreme Commander game make an appaerance, to balance this out players can turn off the option to use these in-game in the menu.

But as mentioned its a fun game, sure the AI can be wacky and the game has been known to really crash you game upon start-up though teh issue is fixed at this point its a fun and relaxing game to try out. Personally the satisfying part is that the game can run even on LOW settings without lagging. As as usual the AI can be wacky with their pathfinding or predicatable moves.
